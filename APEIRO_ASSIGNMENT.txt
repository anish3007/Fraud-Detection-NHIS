💻 The NHIS Fraud Auditor Dashboard Assignment 
🎯 Goal 
Your goal is to build a minimal, functional web application (MVP) that serves as 
a Claims Auditor Dashboard for the NHIS Healthcare Claims and Fraud Dataset 
provided. 
You must complete the core features, deploy the application, and submit your 
work within 8 hours (simulating a workday). You are expected to use AI coding 
assistants and LLMs extensively. 
📊 Dataset 
You must use the data from the following Kaggle source: 
 Dataset: NHIS Healthcare Claims and Fraud Dataset 
 File to Use: You should primarily focus on the main claims data file(s) 
for the core task. 
📝 Problem Statement 
You are a data developer tasked with rapidly prototyping a dashboard for a 
team of claims auditors. The primary function of this application is to process 
the NHIS claims data and use a simple heuristic to automatically flag claims 
with a high likelihood of fraud. 
Your application must demonstrate data loading, basic analysis, a simple 
predictive heuristic, and a user interface for review. 
 
🛠️ Requirements and Deliverables 
Part 1: Technical Implementation (Core Features) 
You may use any language, framework, database, and hosting solution (e.g., 
React/Node/Postgres, Python/Flask/SQLite, or serverless functions with tools 
like Vercel or Replit). 
1. Data Ingestion and Setup: 
o Create a method to load the data from the provided CSV file(s) 
into your application's data layer (e.g., local database, in-memory 
store, etc.). 
2. The "Fraud Likelihood Score" Engine: 
o Design a simple, explainable, and non-ML-based heuristic to 
assign a "Fraud Likelihood Score" (an integer from 0 to 100) to 
every single claim in the dataset. 
o Example Heuristic Idea (You must create your own): Score = 
(Amount billed/ Avg_Charge_for_Procedure) * 100. The complexity 
is up to you, but it must be functional and defendable.  
3. Dashboard View (/): 
o Display three key overall metrics (e.g., Total Number of Claims, 
Average Claim Charge, Number/Percentage of Claims Flagged 
with a score > 75). 
o Display a simple chart (e.g., a bar chart or pie chart) visualizing 
the distribution of claims by their assigned Fraud Likelihood 
Score Category (e.g., Low: 0-25, Medium: 26-75, High: 76-100). 
4. Claims Review View (/claims): 
o Display a paginated or scrollable list of all claims. 
o For each claim, prominently display the assigned Fraud 
Likelihood Score. 
o Include a functional search/filter bar that allows the auditor to 
search claims by different parameters like diagnosis, patient , etc., 
Part 2: AI Tool Fluency and "Vibe Coding" Mandate 
You are required to use LLMs/AI tools for acceleration and must document this 
use. 
1. Prompt Journal: In your final submission's README, include a section 
titled "AI Prompt Journal." This must contain: 
o Your five most effective prompts used for the assignment (e.g., 
generating a specific function, debugging a piece of code, 
defining the database schema, or suggesting the Fraud Heuristic). 
o A brief note on what the AI output was used for. 
2. AI for Testing/Documentation: Use an LLM/AI assistant to generate one 
code snippet for testing (e.g., a unit test for your Fraud Likelihood Score 
function or a test for your API endpoint). Include the generated code and 
the prompt used. 
3. Architectural Decision: Use an LLM/AI assistant to quickly compare two 
specific technical choices relevant to your project (e.g., "Compare using 
Postgres vs. SQLite for this specific application," or "Compare React vs. 
Vue for the frontend dashboard"). Include the prompt and a brief 
summary of the resulting decision you made. 
 
📦 Submission & Evaluation 
Evaluation Focus 
Your solution will be assessed based on the following equally weighted 
criteria: 
Criterion What We Are Looking For 
Technical 
Correctness 
All Core Features are implemented and functional. The 
application is stable and performs basic CRUD/filtering 
operations correctly. 
Code Quality Clean, readable, well-structured, and appropriately 
modularized code. 
AI Tool Fluency 
Demonstrated ability to leverage AI effectively to accelerate 
development. The submitted prompts show strategic 
thinking and complex problem-solving. 
Rapid 
Prototyping 
The scope of the solution reflects strong prioritization and 
scoping to deliver a functional MVP within the time limit.
